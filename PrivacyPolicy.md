# Privacy policy

*Last updated: 15th May 2020*

This privacy policy applies to the Notes for Game Bar app, released on the Windows Store, made by Ian Rodrigues.

## What is collect by the app

The app itself does not collect personal information.
It was required by Microsoft to make this privacy policy because the app does access your files, such as by pressing the corresponding "Load" and "Save" buttons for loading and saving RTF files for the notes that you use in the app.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

I may update this privacy policy as needed, so do check it periodically for any changes. You can also view a history of the changes made to this privacy policy [on Github](https://github.com/Adeginorsu/NotesforGameBarMS/commits/master/PrivacyPolicy.md).
